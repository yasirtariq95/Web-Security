T1 attack is basically defining how XSRF(cross site request forgery) attack works. In this case i used a dummy GaTech payroll site where,<br>i crafted a web page and set the account and routing number of my choice, becasue a person was logged in already and session was active. In this way he/she redirected to my crafted page
